  <h2>What is Short-Term Insurance?</h2>
  <p>
    Short-term insurance provides financial protection for your belongings, 
    vehicles, home, and other assets against unexpected events such as accidents, 
    theft, fire, or natural disasters. Unlike long-term policies, 
    these plans are flexible and can be adjusted to meet your immediate needs.
